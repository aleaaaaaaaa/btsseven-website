      <h1>BTS</h1>
      <p> BTS was formed by Bang Si-Hyuk, a successful songwriter and music producer who established his own studio, Big Hit Entertainment, in 2005. In 2010 he began to assemble talent for a group he was calling the Bangtan Sonyeondan (“Bulletproof Boy Scouts”), which would later become better known as BTS. The members—the first of whom was RM, an underground rapper in Seoul—were selected for their singing, rapping, and dancing skills. The band’s first releases were three EP (extended play) records in the School series, including 2 Cool 4 Skool (2013), O!RUL8,2? (2013), and Skool Luv Affair (2014). BTS’s first full-length album, Dark & Wild, appeared in 2014. The group wrote its own lyrics, commenting on social issues and concentrating on such themes as self-love, individuality, and empowerment. The band’s popularity grew with each recording, and, after releasing The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 1 and Part 2 (both 2015), BTS began its first world tour. With momentum from the tour, Life, Part 2 rose to number one on six international music charts. The album Wings (2016) continued that success, becoming the first of the group’s albums to debut on both the Canadian Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 charts.
